# Tik Tok Auto Views V2 and and the difference
**Tik Tok Auto Views V1 (previous project):**\
  Only get 200-1000 (options) views every 5 minutes (it's good thing and bad thing at the same time)\
  \
**Tik Tok Auto Views V2 (this one), you have 2 options:**
  1. You can get instant 5K views every 10 minutes (still, it's good thing and bad thing at the same time) or
  2. You can get random fans between 15-30 (I think) every 10 minutes
  3. You can get random hearts between 15-30 (I think) every 10 minutes (NEW UPDATE: They removed this features for now)
  
## Requirements
Python 3
  
## Install dependency
<pre>pip install selenium
pip install pyfiglet==0.7.5</pre>

## How to use
1. Download this repo
2. Make sure all dependencies installed
3. Open tiktodv2.py using Code Editor and edit line
<pre>vidUrl = "YOUR_URL" #Change YOUR_URL to your Tik Tok video URL
username = "YOUR_USERNAME" #Change YOUR_USERNAME to your Tik Tok username
auto = 2 #Change 2 for Tik Tok views</pre>
4. python tiktodv2.py
5. **You still have to manual complete gcaptcha check (only for first time you run the code)**

## Few things
1. Use RDP to get tons of views or fans (run 24/7)
2. If you are using Chrome ver 84, you don't need to download chromedriver again (won't cause error). But, if you are not using Chrome ver 84, then download the right version like your Chrome version. [**Download here**](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
